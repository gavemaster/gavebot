      "Summary: On 18 June 2023, Titan, a submersible operated by OceanGate, an American tourism and expeditions company, imploded during its descent in the North Atlantic Ocean, about 320 nautical miles (590 km) off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada. The submersible, carrying five people, was part of an expedition to view the wreck of the Titanic. Communication with Titan was lost 1 hour and 45 minutes into its dive, and authorities were alerted when it failed to resurface at the scheduled time later that day.\n",
      "After a search lasting nearly 80 hours, a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) discovered a debris field containing parts of Titan, about 500 metres (1,600 ft) from the bow of the Titanic. The search area was informed by the United States Navy’s (USN) sonar detection of an acoustic signature consistent with an implosion around the time communications with the submersible ceased, suggesting the pressure hull had imploded while Titan was descending, resulting in the instantaneous deaths of all five occupants.\n",
      "The search and rescue operation was conducted by an international team led by the United States Coast Guard (USCG), USN, and Canadian Coast Guard. Support was provided by aircraft from the Royal Canadian Air Force and United States Air National Guard, a Royal Canadian Navy ship, as well as several commercial and research vessels and ROVs.Numerous industry experts had raised concerns about the safety of the vessel. OceanGate executives, including its CEO Stockton Rush (one of the fatalities in the implosion), had not sought certification for Titan, arguing that excessive safety protocols hindered innovation.\n",

      "Summary: OceanGate Inc. is a privately owned U.S. company in Everett, Washington, that provides crewed submersibles for tourism, industry, research, and exploration. The company was founded in 2009 by Stockton Rush and Guillermo Söhnlein.\n",
      "The company acquired a submersible vessel, Antipodes, and later built two of its own: Cyclops 1 and Titan. In 2021, OceanGate began taking paying tourists in the Titan to visit the wreck of the Titanic. As of 2022, the price to be a passenger on an OceanGate expedition to the Titanic shipwreck was US$250,000 per person.In June 2023 Titan imploded during a voyage to the Titanic shipwreck site, killing all 5 occupants on board, including Rush. An international search and rescue operation was launched and, on June 22, the wreckage was found on the seabed near the Titanic wreck site.\n",

It was released on March 10, 2022 for Microsoft Windows to positive critical reception. A Nintendo Switch port was released on December 19, 2022.
